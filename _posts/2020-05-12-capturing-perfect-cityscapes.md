date: 2023-01-02 00:00:00
description: Understanding readiness for change can help care providers with treatment planning and family communication. The University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA) is commonly used to measure readiness, but its design and language may be more suitable for adults than for adolescents. We examined the suitability of the URICA by exploring its psychometric properties with data from 119 youth who attended a live-in care program in Canada. A three-factor model (Precontemplation, Contemplation, and Action) using 16 of the original 32 items emerged as the most parsimonious approach. The results are discussed in the context of developmental and clinical issues.
