description: Attachment orientation has been identified as both a risk and protective factor for diverse emotional, behavioral, and relational problems. Given its importance, there has been an interest in the stability of attachment orientation throughout lifespan. In this paper, we examine the stability of attachment orientation for youth (N=174) participating in a live-in therapeutic centre with programming through five therapeutic stages. We also compared their attachment orientation with a community-based youths (N=174), using Experience in Close Relations- Relationship Structures Scale. Repeated measures multilevel analyses showed that clinical sample’s levels of anxiousness and avoidance in attachment towards mother, father and friends significantly improved as they progress through stages Three, Four, and Five. Attachment orientation with therapist was lower in anxiousness and avoidance dimensions at Stage Two and as they proceed through stages Three, Four and Five, it further decreased indicating increase in security. The Welsch’s t-test results indicated that clinical youths were significantly higher in anxiousness and avoidance towards mother and father at the time of admission than the community-based youths. Subsequent equivalence testing showed that the attachment orientation was comparable between two groups at the end of treatment of clinical youths. These findings highlight the malleability of attachment orientations in response to therapeutic contact.
