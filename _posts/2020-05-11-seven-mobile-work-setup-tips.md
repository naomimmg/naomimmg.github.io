title: Effect sizes for equivalence testing, Incorporating the equivalence interval 
date: 2023-10-31 00:00:00
description: Equivalence testing (ET) is a framework for determining if an effect is small enough to be considered meaningless, wherein meaningless is expressed as an equivalence interval (EI). Although traditional effect sizes (ESs) are important accompaniments to ET, these measures exclude information about the EI. Incorporating the EI is valuable for quantifying how far the effect is from the EI bounds. The proportional distance (PD) from an observed effect to the smallest effect that would render it meaningful is proposed as an ES measure for ET. We conducted two Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the PD when applied to (1) mean differences and (2) correlations. The coverage rate and bias of the PD were excellent within the investigated conditions. We also applied the PD to two recent psychological studies. These applied examples revealed the beneficial properties of the PD, namely its ability to supply information above and beyond other statistical tests and ESs.
