              <h5 class="title">Incidence and Interpretation of Statistical Suppression in Psychological Research</h5>
              <p class="text-muted small">Authors: Naomi Martinez Gutierrez & Robert Cribbie</p>
              <p>Suppressor variables increase the predictive power of one or more predictors by suppressing irrelevant variance. Although theoretically and statistically useful, no research has addressed the frequency or interpretation of statistical suppression (SS) in the psychological literature. In two studies, we explored the nature and interpretation of SS. In the first study, we reviewed regression analyses to determine the frequency with which SS occurs in psychological articles published in 2017. Approximately one-third of articles showed evidence of SS, although researchers almost never acknowledged or attempted to interpret the SS. In the second study, we reviewed articles containing the keyword “suppression” to assess the interpretations provided by researchers that identified SS. Results indicate that most researchers do not attempt to classify or interpret SS. Therefore, although SS is common in psychology, scarcely any attempts are made to identify, classify, and/or interpret it.</p>

              <p class="text-muted small">Authors: Naomi Martinez Gutierrez & Robert Cribbie</p>
              <p>Equivalence testing (ET) is a framework for determining if an effect is small enough to be considered meaningless, wherein meaningless is expressed as an equivalence interval (EI). Although traditional effect sizes (ESs) are important accompaniments to ET, these measures exclude information about the EI. Incorporating the EI is valuable for quantifying how far the effect is from the EI bounds. The proportional distance (PD) from an observed effect to the smallest effect that would render it meaningful is proposed as an ES measure for ET. We conducted two Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the PD when applied to (1) mean differences and (2) correlations. The coverage rate and bias of the PD were excellent within the investigated conditions. We also applied the PD to two recent psychological studies. These applied examples revealed the beneficial properties of the PD, namely its ability to supply information above and beyond other statistical tests and ESs.</p>
