        <p class="text-muted small">Authors: Naomi Martinez Gutierrez & Robert Cribbie (2023)</p>
        <p class="abstract">Equivalence testing (ET) is a framework for determining if an effect is small enough to be considered meaningless, wherein meaningless is expressed as an equivalence interval (EI). Although traditional effect sizes (ESs) are important accompaniments to ET, these measures exclude information about the EI. Incorporating the EI is valuable for quantifying how far the effect is from the EI bounds. The proportional distance (PD) from an observed effect to the smallest effect that would render it meaningful is proposed as an ES measure for ET. We conducted two Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the PD when applied to (1) mean differences and (2) correlations. The coverage rate and bias of the PD were excellent within the investigated conditions. We also applied the PD to two recent psychological studies. These applied examples revealed the beneficial properties of the PD, namely its ability to supply information above and beyond other statistical tests and ESs.</p>

        <p class="text-muted small">Authors: Naomi Martinez Gutierrez & Robert Cribbie (2021)</p>
        <p class="abstract">Suppressor variables increase the predictive power of one or more predictors by suppressing irrelevant variance. Although theoretically and statistically useful, no research has addressed the frequency or interpretation of statistical suppression (SS) in the psychological literature. In two studies, we explored the nature and interpretation of SS. In the first study, we reviewed regression analyses to determine the frequency with which SS occurs in psychological articles published in 2017. Approximately one-third of articles showed evidence of SS, although researchers almost never acknowledged or attempted to interpret the SS. In the second study, we reviewed articles containing the keyword “suppression” to assess the interpretations provided by researchers that identified SS. Results indicate that most researchers do not attempt to classify or interpret SS. Therefore, although SS is common in psychology, scarcely any attempts are made to identify, classify, and/or interpret it.</p>

        <p class="text-muted small">Authors: Naomi Martinez Gutierrez, Jordana DeSouza, Udi Alter, Stephanie Bell, Nataly Beribisky, Linda Farmus, Eric Tu & Robert Cribbie (2025)</p>
        <p class="abstract">Whenever researchers test multiple hypotheses, the risk that one or more of the hypotheses might be falsely supported (i.e., Type I errors) increases with the number of hypotheses evaluated (i.e., the multiplicity problem). Because most studies evaluate multiple hypotheses, the risk that at least one hypothesis is a Type I error appears substantial. However, it is necessary to evaluate how consistently multiplicity control (MC) is applied and the rationale behind its application, to understand the merit of MC in psychological research. We conducted a systematic review of MC practices in 250 articles from 10 high-impact psychology journals. There was a median of 76 hypotheses tested per article; however, only 7.5% of all hypotheses were protected by MC. The most popular type of MC was familywise error control, via the Bonferroni method. The results highlight the wide range of situations wherein multiplicity occurs, the inconsistency with which MC is applied, and the lack of rationale for MC decisions. We hope that the results will create an active discussion on the merit of MC within the field of psychology.</p>

        <p class="text-muted small">Authors: Linda Farmus, Nataly Beribisky, Naomi Martinez Gutierrez, Udi Alter, Emily Panzarella & Robert Cribbie (2023)</p>
        <p class="abstract">Reporting and interpreting effect sizes (ESs) has been recommended by all major bodies within the field of psychology. In this systematic review, we investigated the reporting of ESs in six social-personality psychology journals from 2018, given that this area has been at the center of psychology’s replication crisis. Our results highlight that although ES reporting is near perfect (even for follow-up tests), interpreting the magnitude of ESs, including confidence intervals for ESs, and interpreting the precision of the confidence intervals needs development. We also highlight widespread confusion regarding the interpretations of the magnitude of ESs within the context of the research.</p>

        <p class="text-muted small">Authors: Tazvin Ijaz, Naomi Martinez Gutierrez & Debra Pepler (2023)</p>
        <p class="abstract">Understanding readiness for change can help care providers with treatment planning and family communication. The University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA) is commonly used to measure readiness, but its design and language may be more suitable for adults than for adolescents. We examined the suitability of the URICA by exploring its psychometric properties with data from 119 youth who attended a live-in care program in Canada. A three-factor model (Precontemplation, Contemplation, and Action) using 16 of the original 32 items emerged as the most parsimonious approach. The results are discussed in the context of developmental and clinical issues.</p>

        <p class="text-muted small">Authors: Joanna Bettmann, Naomi Martinez Gutierrez, Rachel Esrig, Ellison Blumenthal & Laura Mills (2023)</p>
        <p class="abstract">Extensive research into wilderness therapy has not explored who benefits the most and who does not thrive in these programs. The present study examined demographic, clinical, and familial characteristics that distinguished adolescents who improve most in wilderness therapy programs from those who deteriorate. Using data collected by the National Association of Therapeutic Schools and Programs Practice Research Network, the study sample consisted of 5639 adolescents attending wilderness therapy programs which collected and contributed data to the Practice Research Network between 2017 and 2022. Measures included the Youth Outcome Questionnaire-Self Report and the McMaster Family Assessment Device, as well as demographic, familial, and clinical data collected by program staff. Using binary and univariate logistic regression, the study found individual and familial factors that predicted membership in the top 10% of adolescent participants in terms of mental health improvement from pre-to-post wilderness therapy and those factors which predicted membership in the bottom 10% in terms of poorer mental health from pre-to-post program. Considering the intensity, length, and financial resources associated with wilderness therapy program participation, these findings have important implications for wilderness therapy program staff professional development, communication of expectations to adolescents' parents/caregivers, and program admission decisions.</p>

        <p class="text-muted small">Authors: Joanna Bettmann, Naomi Martinez Gutierrez, Annelise Jolley & Laura Mills (2025)</p>
        <p class="abstract">Existing research shows some links between wilderness therapy outcomes and familial functioning. However, wilderness therapy programs do not agree on what kind of caregiver involvement is required to improve adolescent program outcomes, nor has research examined different types of family engagement and their impact on adolescent treatment outcomes. Thus, the present study explored the research question: Does caregiver engagement in adolescent wilderness therapy foster improved outcomes? The study sample consisted of 4067 adolescent wilderness therapy clients from 12 different wilderness therapy programs. Using standardized measures and multilevel structural equation modeling, the authors found that caregiver program participation significantly predicted adolescent mental health outcomes of the program, suggesting that the more caregivers were involved in family interventions during the program, the more likely their adolescent child was to improve in the program. The study also found that greater caregiver effort predicted greater mean change in adolescent mental health outcomes of wilderness therapy. This study suggests the importance of enhancing familial interventions in adolescents’ wilderness therapy programs in order to improve adolescent outcomes. Given findings from this study, wilderness therapy programs should consider expanding the ways that they involve families in treatment in order to optimize adolescent outcomes.</p>
